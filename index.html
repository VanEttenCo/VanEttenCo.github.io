		<h1>Metamorpho</h1>
		<h2>The Element Man</h2>
			
		<p>Metamorpho is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He was created in 1965 by writer Bob Haney and artist Ramona Fradon</p>

		<p>Originally adventurer Rex Mason, he is converted into a man made of a shifting mass of chemicals after being cursed by an ancient artifact that he has retrieved.</p>

		<p>Since the birth of my son Mason, I have decided to adopt the Element Man as my favorite superhero. You can read more about his background on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorpho" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. And if you want to view a short video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuAoT-ptsN0" target="_blank">Youtube</a> you can learn about his link with Egyptian mythology.</p>
