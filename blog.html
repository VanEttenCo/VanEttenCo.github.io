          <p class="blogtext">Coming back to my choice to form my LLC in Delaware, it seemed unclear to me whether I could be using my LLC to deliver services in Oregon without actually registering in the state. Per online resources, the standard for registration as a foreign LLC, i.e. an LLC not formed in the State, seemed to rest on having employees or physical office prescence with an intention on doing repetitive business. This seems to fit for my LLC, although as a single-member LLC, there is a small and remaining doubt that I may have been exempted. If I do end up invoicing companies in other states, I will intend to perform that service from Oregon which I expect pre-empts the need to manage even another registration.</p>
          <p class="blogtext">Once deciding to register in Oregon, I learned I needed a registered agent as well as a document titled Certificate of Existence from my "home-state", Delaware. After procuring these, I registered online with Oregon, struggling a bit with my understanding of each field. The registration is pending and it appears I already mis-interpreted my office location for my registered agent's location. Fingers crossed!</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Obtain an Oregon Registered Agent $125 </p></li>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Obtain DE Certificate Certificate of Existence $124</p></li>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Register with Oregon $275</p></li>    
            </ul>

          <h3 class="blogtitle">Websiting</h3>
          <p class="blogtext">While I had some templates from my coding classes, I needed to determine what I wanted to show on my website. Fortunately, I was aware of a business that provided services similar to those I aspired to and used that as a model.</p>
          <p class="blogtext">Following my new mantra of just going for it, I decided to directly code the website rather than get bogged down in a Content Management System. I may regret this as the site grows, but this would be fastest and allow the most flexibility and learning. The downside is I had to spend a lot of time formatting little boxes and iterating that they showed up as intended, both on mobile and desktop screens. This has taken about 20 hours so far but I am getting faster at spotting errors and moving the page around, so that's a plus.</p>

          <h3 class="blogtitle">Very EINteresting</h3>
          <p class="blogtext">So an EIN, or Employer Identification Number, is a number assigned by the IRS to identfy your company for tax purposes, similar to your Social Security Number.</p>
          <p class="blogtext">I was unsure if I needed this, but it seems like it would be helpful for establishing a bank account or for privacy, i.e. easier to invoice with an EIN rather than my SSN. Additionally, there seemed to be few downsides, other than another fee.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Request EIN $50</p></li>       
            </ul>

          <h3 class="blogtitle">So You Want to Host a Website...</h3>
          <p class="blogtext">In the summer, I enrolled in an online coding course called OneMonth. The aim was to make myself more marketable by learning tools used by smaller businesses, such as running SQL queries. They also had classes on other programming languages, including HTML and CSS. I wanted to put this knowledge into practice and build my website.</p>
          <p class="blogtext">The first step was to buy the Domain Name. I understand GoDaddy had good tools for re-selling so I bought this on their website. Unfortunately, I had a preference to use HostGator for hosting and did not understand at that time that meant a bit more effort to connect the two sites. There were a number of options that came with Hosting and I made a best guess, later coming back to purchase an additional SSL certificate that presents better for search. Needless to say, I don't quite understand everything I bought but through some trial and error, I was able to get a site up on a running.</p>
             <ul>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Buy Domain Registration $12 per year</p></li>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Buy random domain add-ons, security, marketing, etc $21 per year</p></li>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Buy Hosting Service $99 for three years</p></li>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Buy Securelock add-on $36 per year</p></li>            
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Buy SSL Certificate $40 per year</p></li>            
            </ul>

          <h3 class="blogtitle">Taking the Plunge</h3>
          <p class="blogtext">There are many considerations in starting an LLC, but the two biggest I faced were the name and the formation state.</p>
          <p class="blogtext">For the name, I had toyed around with clever quotes from my favorite authors as well as potential investment themes. None of these were satisfying, given that it is still quite unclear the path my LLC will take. Flexibility will be key and there is something to be said for a name that is bland. The product I am selling is myself, and the LLC name should not blur or override my own brand. With street name being quite common in the investment world (i.e Jane Street, Irving Place), I started looking at Portland Street Names. Alder Street sounded great, but the domain name was $10k to own so this was eliminated. Many other street names were already used in LLC names in either Delaware or Oregon so they were excluded. After 11 attempts, I found Northrup Street, which was free in both Delaware and Oregon, and the domain main cost only $0.01 to own.</p>
          <p class="blogtext">In choosing between Delaware and Oregon to register, I found it quite difficult to determine the real implications of the decision. In general, the simplest option is to register in the state you live in and plan on doing business in. However, with the knowledge that I may want to keep the LLC after I re-locate to the Netherlands, I found it difficult to anchor myself to a state that is not well-regarded for being business friendly, something which Delaware is often lauded for. Frankly, I just took the dive and registered in Delaware to get things rolling. Since that time, I've realized that this step resulted in additional steps to register my name in Oregon, entailing additional costs to engage an additional registered agent, obtain a Certificate of Existence from Delaware and register with the State, totaling $524 thus far. To recap:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Determine the Business Structure, i.e. LLC</p></li>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Determine the LLC Name, i.e. Northrup Street, LLC</p></li>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Determine the state to form the LLC, i.e. Delaware</p></li>
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Obtain a Registered Agent in Delaware $125</p></li>            
              <li><p class="blogtext">- Pay Delaware Filing Fee $190</p></li>            
            </ul>

          <h3 class="blogtitle">Why a LLC?</h3>
          <p class="blogtext">With nearly two decades of experience, there is a lot for me to draw on in advising other companies. With medium-term plans to move back to the Netherlands, there is a high probability that I will need to support companies via freelance activities rather than as a full-time employee.</p>
          <p class="blogtext">In relying on freelance work, I realized I would incur expenses in finding clients and marketing myself. I want to ensure these costs are clearly deductable. Additionally, while I don't expect to need it, one should never dismiss the value of the liability shield that an LLC provides.</p>
          <p class="blogtext">Lastly, as an accountant advising small businesses, the experience of starting my own company is invaluable in providing the practical knowledge needed to navigate the various options and administrative burdens that come from starting your own company. With these considerations in mind, away I go!</p>
